# Chain Reaction

Inspired by the android game Chain Reaction, which itself was based on the AmigaOS game Nuclear Reaction.

This is (going to be) a 3D version of the Android Game, where time travel takes part, the use of layers will be configurable, where each layer can either be player interactable, non-player interactable, or a time travel layer, where its values are cloned from another layer.

## Default options will include
 - Simple 2D (player)
 - Simple 3D (player, non-player, player)
 - Simple Time-travel (player, time travel from 1, time travel from 4, player)
